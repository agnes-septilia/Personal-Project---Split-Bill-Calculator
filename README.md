# Split Bill Calculator

### INTRODUCTION
This is a simple split bill calculator.
The idea is based on my personal experience, when I'm hanging out with my friends.
One person will pay the bill first, later on we split the bill and pay our portion.

### TECHNICAL
Language: Python

### HOW THE PROGRAM WORKS
1. First we input the number of people
2. Then input the tax and service charge percentage (only input the number)
3. This is where the loop process started. Start by entering the first person name. Then enter what kind of meal / drink they have, and how much it's price; this can be done more than one meal. 
4. To end the loop process, simply input name or meal/drink as "done".
5. Finally, program will calculate how much bill each person has, included taxes.

### NOTES
1. In my country, some restaurants put service charge around 5 - 7.5%. This is calculated after (total + VAT) amount.
2. Because the program only works for personal meal/drink, if any shared meal, then you have to put the average amount into the program.
