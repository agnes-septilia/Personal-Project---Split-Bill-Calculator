# Personal-Project --- Split-Bill-Calculator --- Language: Python

Hi!

Now, since the github will act as my portfolio, I'm thinking to add some project on my early days with Python.
We all start from very simple things, how to do calculation, manipulate string, etc.
When learning these, one of the program that comes to my mind was Split Bill Calculator.

I have some bestfriends I usually hangout with, and usually one of the person will pay the meal first.
Later, we calculate how much we have to pay our portion to that person.
Basically, we use this split bill things quite often.
Sure, it is far easier doing it by Ms. Excel, but now I need to practice, right?

<<WHAT'S IN THE CODE?>>
First, I made the code on my early coding stage, so don't expect very high-level syntax.
At the time, I even didn't know how function works - eventhough now I'm thinking this would be more efficient to use.

This code starts by asking the number of people, tax %, and service %.
Then it asks input for person's name, what they eat/drink, and how much it will cost.
Here, the menu-price will keep on loop, and add it to the subtotal.
Once done, the result will show final amount that person have to pay.

In the future, one of the syntax I want to add in this program is to count the shared food.
This is because me and my friends tend to share the foods and divide the amount fairly.
Also, I think it would be nice if I could make the output become table-like, not too wordy like recent code.
If later I decided to upgrade the program, these will be the task I'm working on.
Until then, let's keep this as it is.

Cheers! ^^
